Ans.1 - The "Product" entity has a foreign key column called "category_id" that references the primary key of the "Product_Category" entity. 
This indicates that a product belongs to a specific category. 
A product category can have many products, but a product can only belong to one category.



Ans.2 - You could add a foreign key constraint to the Product table that references the Category table. This would ensure that each product has a valid category assigned to it.
Here is the SQL statement to add the foreign key constraint:
ALTER TABLE product ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_category FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES category (id);
